An addon for servers to add cross-server achievements, sprkl server compatable listings, global statistics (playtime, vault money earned, etc.), and more.

### Usage.
If you want to test it out, you can run sprkl locally. We _really_ encourage you don't, as sprkl will communicate with our central servers (this is required for us to send info between servers) and we may end up asking you to remove it. If you actually want to use sprkl, the best place is through one of our official servers found [in our discord](https://discord.gg/stdio). **Running sprkl unauthorized in a production environment will result in a takedown request. Full legal action will be taken if you do not comply.**

If you are running sprkl, it will be running in developer mode, unless authorized by us. You can read the Wiki to figure out how all aspects of sprkl works.

### Legal Stuff.
If you weren't sent this by a member of the Kahppa Studios team, you are not allowed to modify, copy, or use this code. Servers that wish to use this need to [apply on our discord](https://discord.gg/stdio).
